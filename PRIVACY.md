# prune Terms & Privacy

Version: privacy-web-v5

Status: Draft — web adaptation; operator review required before public release.

Last updated: 24 October 2026

## Terms of use

prune is a free personal planning app, independently operated by Davide Fornelli in Italy. There are no subscription fees or in-app purchases. We do not sell your personal data or fund the app with advertising.

By accepting these terms, you agree to use prune lawfully, keep your sign-in codes private, and enter only content you are entitled to use. Do not misuse the service, attempt to access another person's account, or upload unlawful content. Your task content remains yours; we use it only to operate the service as described below.

Automatic weekly reviews use OpenAI to process selected task activity. You can turn reviews off in Profile without losing the planner. AI output may be wrong or unsuitable: check suggestions yourself. prune is not medical, legal, financial or other professional advice and should not be relied on for emergencies or safety-critical work. Accepting these terms acknowledges this feature; it is not blanket consent to personal-data processing.

We aim to keep prune useful, but do not promise uninterrupted service, error-free output or that stored data will never be lost. Keep a separate copy of important information. Features may change or become unavailable; where reasonably possible, we will give advance notice of material changes or closure. We may restrict access where reasonably necessary to address misuse or security risks.

To the extent permitted by applicable law, the free service is provided as available, without additional guarantees, and we are not responsible for indirect losses or losses that were not reasonably foreseeable. Nothing in these terms excludes liability for fraud, intentional misconduct, gross negligence, death or personal injury caused by negligence, or any liability or consumer protection that cannot legally be excluded. These terms do not waive your privacy rights or promise that a disclaimer will apply in every jurisdiction.

Italian law applies, without depriving you of mandatory protections under the law of your country of residence. These terms do not require arbitration or prevent you from bringing a claim in a court available under applicable consumer law. Material changes to these terms will be presented for acceptance before continued use; ordinary sign-in does not require accepting the same version again on the same browser profile.

## Privacy Policy

In short: your planner syncs through Supabase; selected task activity goes to OpenAI for automatic weekly reviews unless you turn them off in Profile. Attached file contents and the Focus notes scratchpad are not sent to AI. We do not sell your data or use advertising trackers. The details and your rights are below.

This notice explains how personal data is processed when you use prune, a web and desktop planner. This version describes the website; the Mac application presents its own notice. It follows the transparency structure of Articles 13 and 14 of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It is not a request to consent to all processing, a waiver of your rights, or a guarantee of regulatory compliance.

## 1. Who is responsible for your data?

The data controller is Davide Fornelli, established in Italy, operating prune. In this notice, “we”, “us” and “our” mean that controller.

A public contact channel for privacy requests, account deletion and support is not currently available. The operator must provide an accessible contact channel before public release. Do not send sign-in codes, passwords or unnecessary identity documents.

## 2. What data do we process, and where does it come from?

- Account and authentication data: the email you provide, your account identifier, sign-in/session records and authentication tokens. Supabase handles email-code authentication. Your email is sent to Supabase to request a one-time sign-in code; the code you enter is sent to Supabase for verification. The website does not use an account password and does not save the code in browser storage or planner data. This website uses the Supabase browser client to keep your session, including refresh and access tokens, in this browser's localStorage. This is not macOS Keychain storage: scripts running on this website's origin can access it. The desktop app uses a separate native credential store.
- Planner data you enter and activity derived from it: task titles, priorities, estimates, planned and completion dates, task status, timer timestamps and recorded focus time, written stop reasons, and completion statistics. The device supplies an IANA timezone for scheduling and local dates. This is not GPS or precise-location collection.
- Resource metadata: labels, filenames, URLs and absolute local file paths you attach to tasks. This metadata syncs to Supabase and may contain personal or confidential information. Attached file contents are not uploaded by prune, and prune does not scan your other files. The current website does not display or edit resources; existing metadata is still included in synced task data and the local cache. Add or open resources in the desktop app. The website cannot open absolute Mac file paths.
- Local app data: an account/project-specific unencrypted planner snapshot and pending-action queue in browser localStorage, plus the combined terms/privacy version and acceptance time. The queue and server sync receipts can contain task text, reasons, resource metadata and mutation results. Sign-out does not erase the planner cache or pending actions.
- Weekly AI data: automatic weekly reviews are on for newly created planner accounts unless you turn them off in Profile. When a review is due, selected task titles, task identifiers, dates, status, estimates, recorded task time, stop identifiers and written stop reasons are sent to OpenAI. Saved weekly reports include the generated reflection and a source-activity snapshot. Resource links, paths, filenames and file contents are excluded from AI input; sensitive information typed directly into a title or reason is not automatically removed.
- Support data: your email address, message and any attachments or diagnostics you choose to send when contacting us. Do not send sensitive task content unless necessary to resolve your request.
- Operational metadata: hosting, authentication and email providers may process IP addresses, request timestamps, technical request/device metadata, delivery records and security logs. These are distinct from planner content.

We receive data from you, your interactions with prune, your device's selected timezone/file metadata, and our authentication and infrastructure providers. We do not obtain planner data from data brokers. The Focus notes scratchpad stays in the current view's memory; prune does not save, sync or send it to AI, and it is lost when that task/view state is discarded or the app is reloaded.

Avoid entering special-category data (for example health, political or religious information), criminal-offence information, secrets, or other people's personal data into tasks or stop reasons. Automatic weekly reviews are not permission to process every possible category of sensitive information. Only attach or enter information you are entitled to use.

## 3. Why do we process data, and on what legal basis?

- Providing the service you request — GDPR Article 6(1)(b), performance of a contract or steps at your request before entering it: authenticating your account, storing and syncing your planner, running timers, associating resources, displaying your history/statistics, recording notice acknowledgement and resolving service requests. Account email and the relevant planner data are necessary for these features; if you do not provide them, those features cannot be supplied. You choose what to enter in optional text and resource fields.
- Automatic weekly AI reflections — proposed basis: Article 6(1)(f), legitimate interests in helping users reflect on their planning activity. Before public rollout, the operator must complete and document a necessity and balancing assessment, confirm that this basis is appropriate for the actual service and users, and update this draft if it is not. A default-on setting or privacy-notice acknowledgement is not consent. You can object and stop future reviews in Profile without losing tasks, timers or cloud sync. See section 4.
- Security, abuse prevention, reliable delivery and handling disputes — Article 6(1)(f), legitimate interests, where applicable: protecting accounts and infrastructure, preventing duplicate sync operations, investigating faults and responding to non-contractual enquiries or legal claims. We must limit this processing to what is necessary, balance it against your rights, and document that assessment. You may object on grounds relating to your situation.
- Legal duties — Article 6(1)(c), only where a specific applicable law requires processing or disclosure, such as responding to a binding lawful request. This is not a general justification to retain all data indefinitely. We will identify the applicable obligation when relying on it, unless legally prohibited.

Acknowledging this notice is not consent to AI, advertising or unrelated uses. We do not sell personal data. This web app uses Vercel Web Analytics to measure production page views. Query strings and URL fragments are removed before analytics events are sent; we do not send task content or custom planner events to analytics. Vercel processes analytics requests and associated technical metadata; see https://vercel.com/docs/analytics/privacy-policy. Google Ads, GoatCounter and other advertising trackers from the previous marketing site remain disabled. No advertising or marketing consent is requested by the first-launch screen.

## 4. Automatic weekly AI reviews and your choices

Weekly reviews are enabled automatically for new planner accounts; no separate AI enable step is required. Existing account preferences are preserved, including disabled reviews. The server checks your account setting before allowing generation. The backend retains legacy consent-version fields for compatibility; these are not evidence of affirmative consent under this default-on flow.

Reviews run Sunday at 4:00 p.m. in your device's local timezone while a signed-in client is open, or catch up at the next launch. They cover Monday through generation time; later Sunday activity is not included. If several weeks were missed, only the latest due week is reviewed. No request is made for a week without recorded tasks or stops. The website does not offer manual previews.

Open Profile and choose “Turn off weekly reviews” to stop future reviews at any time. Turning reviews off prevents new generation reservations and prevents in-flight results being saved if the preference revision has changed. It does not recall data already transmitted to OpenAI or erase previous reviews automatically. Requests already sent and provider security/retention obligations may continue to apply. You can turn reviews back on in Profile, or request erasure of existing reviews and source snapshots through a privacy contact channel once one is available. Tasks, timers and cloud sync continue to work with reviews off.

The OpenAI API is called with store: false. This is not a promise of zero retention, no international transfers, or a particular provider training policy. The operator must verify the applicable API agreement, project controls and provider retention before enabling hosted AI.

AI reflections can be inaccurate. They do not score task value, edit tasks or timers, or make decisions producing legal or similarly significant effects on you. You decide whether to act on a suggestion.

## 5. Who receives personal data?

- Website hosting: Vercel when deployed there. The host delivers the web application and may process IP addresses, request timestamps and technical/security logs. Planner API requests go from your browser directly to Supabase, not through a Vercel planner proxy. The operator must review actual hosting regions, subprocessors and log retention before release.
- Supabase: account authentication, hosted database, server functions and associated infrastructure, including applicable subprocessors. The operator reports using a hosted Supabase project on the Free plan with its database in Ireland.
- Authentication email delivery: Supabase and the operator-configured transactional email provider process your email address, one-time sign-in messages and delivery/security metadata. The operator must identify the actual SMTP provider, its processing terms and retention before release.
- OpenAI: selected activity for automatic weekly AI reflections while reviews are enabled, including relevant API infrastructure and subprocessors. Task titles, identifiers, dates, status, estimates, recorded time, stop identifiers and written stop reasons are included. Attached resource metadata, links, paths, filenames, file contents and the Focus notes scratchpad are excluded. Sensitive text typed directly into titles or reasons is still sent.
- Authorised operator personnel or professional advisers, only where necessary for support, security, service administration or legal duties, subject to appropriate confidentiality and access controls.
- Public authorities or other recipients only where required by applicable law or necessary to establish, exercise or defend legal claims, with the applicable legal basis and safeguards.

The operator must have appropriate data-processing terms with processors and assess any processing for which a provider acts as an independent controller. We do not share your planner with other users. If you choose to open a resource URL or contact support, your browser/email application and the destination service process that interaction under their own policies. prune does not upload an attached file merely because you open it locally.

## 6. International transfers

Provider processing, support access and subprocessors may be located outside the European Economic Area or your country. Selecting an EU database region alone does not guarantee that all authentication, support, email or AI processing stays in the EEA.

Before making a restricted transfer, the operator must confirm an applicable lawful mechanism, such as a relevant adequacy decision or European Commission Standard Contractual Clauses, assess the destination and apply supplementary measures where required. An acknowledgement or review preference is not blanket consent to unrestricted international transfers.

## 7. How long is data kept?

- Cloud account and planner history, stop reasons, resource metadata, saved weekly reviews and their source snapshots: while you maintain your account, until account deletion or a justified earlier administrative deletion. No automatic inactive-account expiry is currently configured. You may request erasure at any time, subject to the limited legal exceptions below. Only the latest 52 saved reviews are displayed, but older reports may remain in the database.
- Server sync receipts: kept with the account until deletion to prevent duplicate replay of pending actions, and may contain earlier request data and results. Removing a resource or changing text in the current planner does not necessarily remove older values from these receipts. We must assess and action an erasure request across these copies, not only the currently visible row.
- Local planner snapshot and pending actions: persist on each device until its browser/site storage is cleared. Sign-out retains them. Clearing local storage can permanently lose unsynced work. Account deletion does not remotely wipe every device's cache; arrange removal of local copies on all your devices. Closing a tab or signing out does not clear the planner cache. Use a trusted browser profile and consider local copies on every device.
- Local terms acceptance and privacy acknowledgement: the current document version and acceptance time remain in this browser profile's localStorage until replaced by a later acceptance or app storage is cleared. This is a device-local record, not an account-wide acceptance or AI-consent register. Another browser or cleared site storage may require acceptance again.
- Session credentials: the website clears its locally saved session on sign-out. Server revocation is best-effort during network failures; an issued access token can remain valid until expiry. The Mac app's session is separate and signing out here does not intentionally sign it out.
- Operational AI content: successful operational retry output is cached for seven days; temporary source activity is cleared on completion/failure or by cleanup after an expired lease. Per-account request/quota metadata is removed after 90 days. Aggregate daily usage counters are removed after 90 days and monthly counters after one year. These periods require the retention cleanup job to run successfully and do not delete durable saved reviews.
- Deletion from the active database does not immediately erase provider backups. Restoring a backup must not permanently undo an erasure request.
- OpenAI processing and security retention: store: false does not override provider retention requirements.

We may retain only the data necessary for a specific legal obligation or legal claim for the applicable period, restricting its use accordingly. Data that is genuinely anonymised and no longer reasonably identifies anyone may be retained separately. Pseudonymous identifiers alone do not make data anonymous.

## 8. Your GDPR rights and how to use them

Subject to the applicable legal conditions, you can request access and a copy of your personal data; correction of inaccurate data; erasure; restriction of processing; and portability of data you provided that we process automatically on consent or contract grounds, in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. You may object to processing based on legitimate interests, including automatic weekly AI reviews, and turn reviews off as described above. Where any processing relies on consent, you may withdraw that consent at any time. If we introduce direct marketing, you have an unconditional right to object to it.

A contact channel for requests for access, export, correction or deletion of your account/data must be provided before public release; none is currently published on this website. There is currently no in-app account-deletion or export button. We may need proportionate information to verify account ownership and clarify your request, but will not ask you to send a sign-in code or unnecessary identity documents. We must communicate the action taken without undue delay and normally within one month of receipt; any lawful extension of up to two further months for complexity or volume must be explained within the first month. Requests are normally free; statutory exceptions are limited.

Account deletion removes the Auth account and associated active-database planner rows, reviews, source snapshots, sync receipts and private AI request records through cascading deletion. Aggregate non-account usage counters can remain. Backup, provider-log and device-local copies follow section 7. Sync or export any work you want to keep before requesting deletion. We will explain any data we cannot lawfully erase and the reason/retention period.

You may complain to a supervisory authority, particularly in the EEA country of your habitual residence, place of work or the alleged infringement, without contacting us first. The European Data Protection Board also publishes a directory of EEA authorities. You may seek a judicial remedy where available.

## 9. Security and device privacy

The app uses HTTPS for production cloud connections, Supabase-managed browser sessions, and per-account database access controls. These measures reduce risk but do not make any service completely secure. Browser session storage and the planner cache/outbox are unencrypted site data, not protected by the Mac credential store, and may be accessible to someone with access to your device or backups. Use a protected device account and disk encryption; do not use a shared device for confidential planning without considering these risks.

Our application code is designed not to log credentials or raw AI activity in error messages. Infrastructure logging, administrator access, backup controls and incident response must also be configured appropriately by the operator. If a personal-data breach occurs, the operator must assess and meet any applicable authority and affected-person notification duties.

## 10. Local storage, children and changes to this notice

The app uses localStorage for the planner snapshot, durable sync queue and this notice's acknowledgement, and a separate Supabase localStorage entry for the browser session. These support the service you request; they are not advertising cookies. We do not ask for a blanket cookie consent or optional tracking consent when no such tracking is present. Platform/provider storage and any future tracking must be assessed separately under applicable law.

prune is intended for people aged 16 and over, not directed at children. No age-verification or parental-consent flow is currently implemented. If you believe a child has supplied personal data contrary to applicable requirements, contact us so we can assess and delete it where appropriate.

We will update this notice when processing changes and show a new acknowledgement screen when the notice version changes. A changed notice does not itself authorise new processing; materially new purposes or data uses require an appropriate lawful basis and consent where necessary. The combined checkbox records acceptance of the terms of use and acknowledgement of this privacy notice on this device, not consent to all processing or an agreement to surrender your data-protection rights.
